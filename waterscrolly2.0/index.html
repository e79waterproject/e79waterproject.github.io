                <p class ="scroll_trigger" style="opacity:0;">The most common sources of lead in drinking water are lead pipes, faucets, and plumbing fixtures.
                    Certain pipes that carry drinking water from the water source to the home may contain lead.
                    Household plumbing fixtures, welding solder, and pipe fittings made prior to 1986 may also contain lead. </p>
